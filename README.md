# Analyzing Hotels on Google Search: The Impact of Ratings, Number of Reviews, Amenities, and Attractions
## A Data-Driven Approach Using Web Scraping and Visualization

The main goal of this project was to provide a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the hospitality industry by utilizing web scraping and data visualization. By extracting data from the Google Hotels search, the project focused on several key metrics including total rate, hotel ratings, number of reviews, customer-mentioned amenities and features, nearby attractions, and attractions distances to optimize total stay rates.

1. Data Extraction: Utilized web scraping to gather data from Google Hotels with the extraction based on the user's choice of destination for a 6-night stay for 2 adults from December 22-28, 2024.

2. Data Cleaning and Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights within the dataset. This included analyzing the relationships between ratings, total rates, and amenities.

3. Visualization: Created various bar plots, scatter plots, heat maps, and histograms to represent the data visually.

4. Dashboard and Insights: Provided actionable insights into how factors such as hotel amenities and ratings influence pricing, aiming to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions in the hospitality sector.

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven methods in understanding market trends and consumer preferences in the hospitality industry.
